Semcrement strives to be a small and basic PHP tool which will tell you about the upcoming [semver](http://semver.org) based version your project should have.
To do this it compares structure definitions of your project's code in between commits.
This way you can test the impact of your changes to your upcoming release version before accidentally creating a new major release. ;)
